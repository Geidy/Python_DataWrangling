# Python_DataWrangling
loading Dataset and changing the format for best analysis practice

Data wrangling is used to convert data from an initial format to a format that may be better for analysis.

Handle missing values
Correct data formatting
Standardize and normalize data

Binning
Why binning?
Binning is a process of transforming continuous numerical variables into discrete categorical 'bins' for grouped analysis.

Data Normalization
Why normalization?
Normalization is the process of transforming values of several variables into a similar range. Typical normalizations include
scaling the variable so the variable average is 0
scaling the variable so the variance is 1
scaling the variable so the variable values range from 0 to 1

Data Standardization
You usually collect data from different agencies in different formats. (Data standardization is also a term for a particular type of data normalization where you subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation.)
What is standardization?
Standardization is the process of transforming data into a common format, allowing the researcher to make the meaningful comparison.
